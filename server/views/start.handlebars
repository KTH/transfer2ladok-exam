    <h1>Canvas to Ladok</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the LTI-application that will transfer grades to Ladok from the Canvas Gradebook in this course. This
      application has been developed with the intent to enable a digital transfer of grades from Canvas Gradebook to
      Ladok and hopefully also reduce the manual management of grades. Thus, make the process safer and reduce the time
      that is spent in the process.</p>
    <h2>How do I start using the application?</h2>
    <p>If you have not used this application before, please read the instructions carefully of Canvas Gradebook and this
      application in Canvas@KTH (länk: https://kth.instructure.com/courses/1/pages/step-7-information-grades ). Click
      the button below to start using the application.</p>
    <h2>Important to notice</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The application can transfer letter grades from a column in Canvas Gradebook to draft status for a Ladok
        module (i.e. not the final grade of the course). In the next step, you will have to choose which column in
        Canvas Gradebook that should be transferred to which Ladok module. Make sure that the column in Canvas Gradebook
        contains the allowed letter grades for the Ladok module.</li>
      <li>The grade F is a special case. When you want to transfer grades for the second time (e.g. after a re-exam) for
        a Ladok module, make sure that you in the list uncheck the student that did not participate in the examination,
        but previously had an F. Otherwise the grade will be transferred to draft status for the Ladok module, but with
        a new date.</li>
